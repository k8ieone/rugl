# PyCity

## What is this? 
This is going to be small city simulator **hopefully** with simple 2d graphics

## About future.. 
* The main goal is to create city simulator where you can create or delete buildings, destroy the city with some natural disaster or anything you like!
* Long-term goal is to create webapp for this 
* Integrate a pyLogin (RUGL/python3/pylogin) or ISY (RUGL/python3/isy)
* Create simple 2d graphics. (Propably with pygame)

## Is it really going to be finished?
Well.. Yogy is the maintainer of this one so noone is sure about it
