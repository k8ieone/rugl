Kinda like seedship on Android  
It will serve you as an easily portable program for learning different languages

# You can start as a group of size between 30 to 1 person
The bigger the group, the smaller the stability.  
These are the basic stats:
 * Food
 * Hunger
 * Water
 * Thirst
 * Number of people
 * Group stability
 * Stress
 * (Energy)

## Questions
 Do I make it possible to manage individual characters or just manage the entire group?  
 Managing the entire group would be less time-consuming (both for programming and for playing)
