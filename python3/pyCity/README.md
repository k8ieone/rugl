# PyCity

## What is this? 
This is going to be small city simulator **hopefully** with simple 2d graphics. Unlike Cities: Skyline or Simcity yuo are gonna start with pre-generated city that you can modify.

## About future.. 
* The main goal is to create city simulator where you can create or delete buildings, destroy the city with some natural disaster or anything you like!
* Long-term goal is to create webapp for this 
* Integrate a [pyLogin (RUGL/python3/pylogin)] or [ISY (RUGL/python3/isy)]
* Create simple 2d graphics. (Propably with pygame)
* Use something like picotui for non-final versions and maybe few finals
* Create gui
* Create some sort of "Creative" mode when creating new city

## ..And present
First few versions are not gonna be playable at all. They will always start from the total beginning. They will not have any graphics. When the first final release is out, it's gonna be named something like "pyCity fv. 1" - meaning pyCity is on final version 1

## Is it really going to be finished?
Well.. Yogy is the maintainer of this one so noone is sure about it

## Suggestions
If you have any ideas what to add to game or how to improve it, try to briefly describe it in issues

### Managment 
This is going to be pretty messy since this is first time when I'm trying to make multi-file app in python. If you have any advice for me how to improve imports or directories managment, try to describe it in issues
