Kinda like seedship on Android  
It will serve you as an easily portable program for learning different languages

You cycle through all the characters and depending on their character do stuff. 

# You can start as a group of size between 30 to 1 person
The bigger the group, the smaller the stability.  
These are the basic stats:
 * Food
 * Hunger
 * Water
 * Thirst
 * Number of people
 * Group stability
 * Stress
 * (Energy)

Character introversion/extroversion [Relevant documents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraversion_and_introversion):
 * Introvert
 * Exrtovert

Temperaments [Relevant documents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_temperaments):
 * Sanguine
 * Choleric
 * Melancholic
 * Phlegmatic

## Questions
 ~~Do I make it possible to manage individual characters or just manage the entire group?~~ - individual characters  
 Should there be a linear story or will it be mostly descision based?  
 Will this be a strategy game or a story game?  
  * Now I am thinking more of a story game, because of it's RNG nature...
  * You can't really predict and plan with RNG...
  * My laziness kicks in and I decided to NOT hide the character traits form the player.  
 Do I make the class generate stuff or do I make a separate function?
  * I'm thinking reusability, so separate functions...
  * On the other hand, it would be nicer to have it done on object creation

## Tasks
 Make a character generator
