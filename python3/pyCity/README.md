# PyCity

## What is this? 
This is going to be small city simulator **hopefully** with simple 2d graphics

## About future.. 
* The main goal is to create city simulator where you can create or delete buildings, destroy the city with some natural disaster or anything you like!
* Long-term goal is to create webapp for this 
* Integrate a [pyLogin (RUGL/python3/pylogin)] or [ISY (RUGL/python3/isy)]
* Create simple 2d graphics. (Propably with pygame)

## Is it really going to be finished?
Well.. Yogy is the maintainer of this one so noone is sure about it

## Suggestions
If you have any ideas what to add to game or how to improve it, try to briefly describe it in issues

### Managment 
This is going to be pretty messy since this is first time when I'm trying to make multi-file app in python. If you have any advice for me how to improve imports or directories managment, try to describe it in issues
