# What is this?
This is a MAC address changer script. It changes your MAC address.
# How do I use it?
You just run it as root (or with `sudo`) and the script will guide you through the process.
# Possible problems?
If you need to revert to your original MAC address, answer "yes" to the question about reverting.
