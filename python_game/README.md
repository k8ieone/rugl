# Install guide
You want to install **this very program** and have *no idea* how. Well let me tell you:

1. Get Python3 installed
1. Clone this repo
1. cd into the repo folder
1. pip -r requirements.txt
1. Run python game.py

# What are we trying to accomplish?
Get our teacher to allow us to play a game in programming.
She told us that if we want to play games in her class we have to program them first.
So that is what we are doing!
