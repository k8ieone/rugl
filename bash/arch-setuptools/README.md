### What can I do with this?
This is a set of bash scripts that will help you deploy Arch Linux.
### Is it ready?
# NO and UNLESS YOU WANT TO BREAK YOUR SYSTEM DO NOT RUN THIS ANY OF THE PROVIDED SCRIPTS
### Usage:
todo...
### Where are we going with this?
If you are installing Arch on over 5 computers (like me) it can get pretty anoying and repettitive pretty quickly. This set of scripts is not for completely automating the install process but to make it easier and much quicker.
